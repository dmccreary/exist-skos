<!-- sample XML instance of a SKOS Concept 
     that uses SKOS as the default namespace with Dublin Core Elements for other metadata--><!--  A concept is any idea or notion; a unit of thought.  In practice in a metadata registry we are using
this to store business terminology with definitions for classification of data elements 
Note that the "about" attribute is tricky.  How to make it semantic and "rest" full.  -->

    <note>NoSQL is not a product, a single pattern or an exclusive club.
        NoSQL is not only about horizontally scalable architectures.
        NoSQL is not only about clever use of caching, RAM or SSD.

    <history-note>The term became popular around 2009 with a series of Meetups for people that were not using RDBSM.</history-note>
